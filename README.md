# VehicleWorking
To create a program to illustrate the working of a vehicle(bike, car, truck) where the vehicle would have a fuel capacity. 
Create 2 methods - one which would move the vehicle and reduce the fuel from it, another one which would fill the fuel into the vehicle.
Show how would the vehicle go on to a journey. Use stateful object for the vehicle to hold the current fuel value.
Considerations -

  1-The fuel capacity of the vehicle is 50 ltrs
  2-Moving the vehicle once reduces 20 ltrs
  3-You have to move the vehicle 3 times

Hint - We can move the vehicle 2 times and refuel the vehicle and move the vehicle again.
